Collection

List - List where each element can occur more than once. elements in a List has an internal order, and the elements can be iterated in that order.

Set - the same element cannot occur more than once and elements in a Set has no guaranteed internal order
HashSet();
LinkedHashSet guaranteeing that the order of the elements during iteration is the same as the order they were inserted into the LinkedHashSet.
TreeSet also guarantees the order of the elements when iterated, but the order is the sorting order of the elements
